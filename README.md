    <h1>Front End Development Libraries Projects</h1>
    <h2>Build a Drum Machine</h2>
    <p align="justify">Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to this: <a href="https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/MJyNMd">https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/MJyNMd</a>.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use
      whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.</p>
    <p align="justify">You can use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React,
      Redux, and jQuery to complete this project. You should use a frontend
      framework (like React for example) because this section is about learning
      frontend frameworks. Additional technologies not listed above are not
      recommended and using them is at your own risk. We are looking at
      supporting other frontend frameworks like Angular and Vue, but they are
      not currently supported. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports
      that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!</p>
    <p align="justify"><strong>User Story #1</strong>: I should be able to see an outer
      container with a corresponding <strong>id="drum-machine"</strong> that
      contains all other elements.</p>
    <p align="justify"><strong>User Story #2</strong>: Within <strong>#drum-machine</strong> I
      can see an element with a corresponding <strong>id="display"</strong>.</p>
    <p align="justify"><strong>User Story #3</strong>: Within <strong>#drum-machine</strong> I
      can see 9 clickable drum pad elements, each with a class name of <strong>drum-pad</strong>,
      a unique id that describes the audio clip the drum pad will be set up to
      trigger, and an inner text that corresponds to one of the following keys
      on the keyboard: <strong>Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C</strong>. The drum
      pads MUST be in this order.</p>
    <p align="justify"><strong>User Story #4</strong>: Within each <strong>.drum-pad</strong>,
      there should be an HTML5 <strong>audio </strong>element which has a <strong>src
        </strong>attribute pointing to an audio clip, a class name of clip, and
      an id corresponding to the inner text of its parent <strong>.drum-pad</strong>
      (e.g. <strong>id="Q", id="W", id="E" </strong>etc.).</p>
    <p align="justify"><strong>User Story #5</strong>: When I click on a <strong>.drum-pad</strong>
      element, the <strong>audio </strong>clip contained in its child audio
      element should be triggered.<strong><br>
      </strong></p>
    <p align="justify"><strong>User Story #6</strong>: When I press the trigger key associated
      with each <strong>.drum-pad</strong>, the audio clip contained in its
      child <strong>audio </strong>element should be triggered (e.g. pressing
      the <strong>Q</strong> key should trigger the drum pad which contains the
      string <strong>Q</strong>, pressing the <strong>W</strong> key should
      trigger the drum pad which contains the string <strong>W</strong>, etc.).</p>
    <p align="justify"><strong>User Story #7</strong>: When a<strong> .drum-pad</strong> is
      triggered, a string describing the associated audio clip is displayed as
      the inner text of the <strong>#display</strong> element (each string must
      be unique).</p>
